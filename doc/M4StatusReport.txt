Milestone 4 Status Report
Completed User Stories:

1.	The user can type the command "delete filename" to the shell to
	delete files off the disk. This requires implementing writeSector
	and deleteFile functions.

	Actual Development Time: 1 hour
	Estimated Time: 2 hours
	
1.b	If the user enters the command "type filename" after the file has
	been deleted, nothing should be printed out. Opening up floppya.img
	with hexedit before and after calling delete should show Map entries
	changed to 0 and file marked as deleted in the Directory.
	
	Estimated Time: goes with above
	
2.	The user is able to enter the command "copy filename1 filename2" to
	create a file with name filename2 that contains all the bytes of
	filename1.
