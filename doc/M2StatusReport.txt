Milestone 2 Status Report
User Stories Completed:

1. Use interrupt 0x10 to print a string input from AL register to the
	screen. Test case will be the hidden function call
	printString("Hello World\0").

	Actual Development Time: 15 Minutes
	Estimated Development Time: 1 hour
	
2. Write function readString that will reapeatedly call interrupt 0x16
	to print ASCII code for keyboard input until ENTER key is pressed.
	All characters typed should be printed to the screen. The BACKSPACE
	key is printed but not stored in readString array (decrement index
	instead). When run in Bochs, user should be promted to enter a line
	that is echoed on the next line when user presses ENTER.
	
	Actual Development Time: 1 hour
	Estimated Development Time: 1 hour
	
3. Write function readSector that uses interrupt 0x13 to read a sector
	into buffer. This requires mod and div functions. Testing requires
	reading a sector containing ASCII and printing it using printString.
	
	Actual Development Time: 1.5 hours
	Estimated Development Time: 45 minutes
	
4. Write function handleInterrupt21 that uses interrupt 0x21 to print
	a message to the screen. Test if output is actually printed.
	
	Actual Development Time: 15 minutes
	Estimated Development Time: 45 minutes
	
5.	Redefine handInterrupt21 to be able to call printString, readString,
	and readSector. The program should wait for user to read in a line
	then echo it back on the next line.

	Actual Development Time: 15 minutes	
	Estimated Development Time: 1.5 hours
